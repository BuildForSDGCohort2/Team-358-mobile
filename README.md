This is FASGD-III-Mobile by Team-358-Group-A.

Participating in the Build4SDG with facebook & andela (Cohort-2) we are building a Face/Voice recognition and gesture control security software. It can be used at home to monitor activities in the house even while the owner is away. It can also be used to monitor activities within acquired landed properties to know when there's an intruder without having to pay a watchman.

This is the mobile application for this project built with React Native.
